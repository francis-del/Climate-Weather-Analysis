A team of analysts faced the challenge of analyzing a vast amount of forecast data spanning 100 years, totaling 9TB. The initial solution involved sequential processing, but due to time constraints and the continuous influx of new data, this approach proved impractical. The team aimed to process 24 hours of data in under two hours, significantly reducing the overall processing time.

To achieve this goal, the team proposed using big data processing techniques, specifically employing parallel processing. The analogy of a restaurant's growth in staff to handle increased demand was used to explain the concept. In parallel processing, the workload is distributed among multiple processing units, enhancing efficiency.

The code for sequential and parallel processing was explained, highlighting the differences in implementation. The analysis considered factors such as dataset size, the number of datasets, and the desired processing time. The conclusion suggested that approximately 19 processors would be needed to meet the goal of analyzing 24 hours of data in just under two hours.

In terms of next steps, two options were presented:

Option 1: High-Powered Local Setup

Purchase high-powered processors and computers.
Set up a secure location for servers, considering safety, security, and monitoring.
Account for ongoing expenses like electricity, workspace, and personnel.
Estimated cost: A significant investment, potentially exceeding 150,000 Sterling pounds.
Option 2: Cloud-Based Solution

Rent a cloud server with a 20-core processor at a reasonable hourly rate.
Avoid the overheads of physical infrastructure and staff.
Estimated cost: Approximately 29,000 Sterling pounds over the project's duration.
Advantages include flexibility to upgrade as new, more powerful processors become available.
